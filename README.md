# XR-Web

This project will hopefully soon be used to generate
https://extinctionrebellion.de

Issues and pull requests are very welcome. If something is hard to understand or
should be explained in this readme, please also create an Issue.

The same goes for content: If you don't feel comfortable making the relevant changes
yourself, create an Issue.


## Getting Started
[Getting Started]: #getting-started

1. Install [Git] and
2. Clone the repository. You may want to [fork] it before.  
   `git clone https://github.com/xrebel/xr-web.git`
3. Enter the repository.  
   `cd xr-web`
4. Checkout the plugins repository.  
   `git submodule update --init`
5. Install [pipenv].  
   `pip3 install --user pipenv`
   For Mac OSX Users, it is recommended to use a package manager (Homebrew seems to be most convenient): `brew install pipenv`
   More info about Homebrew: https://brew.sh
6. Install [pyenv] as described on their website.
   This allows us to specify the Python version we want to use.
7. Install the development environment.  
   `pipenv install --dev`  
   If you want to specify a python version because installation of the
   proposed one does not work, use the `--python` parameter.  
   `pipenv --python python3 install --dev`  
   Likewise, you can do this with all following `pipenv` commands.

## Running the project

1. `pipenv run make devserver` (You need to have GNU make installed)
2. Open your browser at [localhost:8000]
3. Start changing things :) If you notice anything weird, don't hesitate to
   create an issue.

   to pull changes from the original repository.  
   `git remote add upstream https://github.com/xrebel/xr-web.git`

   - ssh: `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/xr-web.git`
